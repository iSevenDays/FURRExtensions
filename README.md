# FURRExtensions
Some of the foundation extensions that I need. This is not something intended to be useful to a larger audience 
but I certainly don't mind if you can put it to good use.

With the beginning of version 0.3 the `master` branch is on Swift 3 now. If you need Swift 2.3 code see `swift2`

Have fun and don't hesitate to create pull requests
